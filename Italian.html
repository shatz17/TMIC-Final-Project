            <h3>How to Make Pizza Dough:</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="ingredient-number">1.</span> In a small bowl, stir together water, honey, and salt then
                sprinkle the top with 1/2 tsp yeast and let sit 5 minutes then stir.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">2.</span> Measure 3 1/3 cups flour in a large mixing bowl and make a
                well in the center. Pour
                yeast
                mixture into the center then stir with a firm spatula until the dough comes together. Knead by hand 2
                minutes (dough will be sticky). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature 4-5
                hours or until doubled in size.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">3.</span> Transfer dough to a floured surface, turn to coat lightly in
                flour so it isn’t sticky
                then divide in half. Fold each piece of dough in half 8 times, gently pulling the sides over the center
                like closing a book, turning the dough each time and repeating for 8 folds. Form a ball in your hands
                and transfer each piece of dough to a lightly oiled bowl seam-side-down, cover and refrigerate overnight
                (18 hours) or up to 1 week.

            <h2>How to form a Pizza Crust:</h2>
            <span class="ingredient-number">1.
            </span>
            <b>PREP:</b> Remove the dough 1 hour before using to let it relax and come to room temperature. Before
            forming the pizza crust, fully preheat your oven so pizza can be baked right away. Place a pizza stone or
            inverted baking sheet onto the center rack of the oven and preheat to 550˚F. Also, lightly flour a pizza
            peel and prep toppings.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">2.</span>When dough is about room temperature and oven is preheated,
            transfer 1 piece of dough to a floured surface, turning to lightly coat in flour. Pat the center of the
            dough gently with fingertips. DO NOT pop any bubbles present.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">3.</span>Lift the dough over both knuckles and roll your knuckles under the
            center of the dough, working outward as you rotate the dough along your knuckles and leaving a thicker crust
            at the edge. Continue working the dough until a 10-12” pizza has formed. It will shrink slightly so make it
            a little bigger than you think. Place the dough down on a lightly floured pizza peel. Give the pizza peel a
            little shake to make sure the pizza slides over it and is not sticking.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">4.</span>Spread on desired pizza sauce and toppings. Give the pizza another
            jolt to make sure it slides on the pizza peel (you don’t want it to stick while transferring it into the
            oven). Slide pizza onto the preheated pizza stone and bake at 550˚F for 8-10 minutes or until crust is
            golden brown and some of the larger bubbles on the crust are lightly scorched to ensure a crisp crust.
