            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="ingredient-number">1.</span>Cut the pork into long strips or chunks about 2 to 3 inches
                thick. Don’t trim any excess fat, as it
                will render off and add flavor.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">2.</span>Combine the sugar, salt, five spice powder, white pepper,
                sesame oil, wine, soy sauce, hoisin sauce,
                molasses, food coloring (if using), and garlic in a bowl to make the marinade (i.e. the BBQ sauce).
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">3.</span>Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade and set it aside. Rub
                the pork with the rest of the marinade
                in a large bowl or baking dish. Cover and refrigerate overnight, or at least 8 hours. Cover and store
                the reserved marinade in the fridge as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">4.</span> your oven to 'bake' at 475 F (246 C) with a rack positioned in
                the upper third of the oven.
                (If you only have a convection oven, keep in mind the oven not only heats more quickly, your char siu
                will roast faster than what we have described here).
                Using an oven thermometer to double-check the actual oven temperature is a great safeguard to monitor
                your food (I say double-check because even oven thermostat calibrations vary and can sometimes be
                incorrect).
                Regardless, be sure to check your char siu every 10 minutes, reducing or increasing the temperature as
                needed.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">5</span>Line a sheet pan with foil and place a metal rack on top. Using
                the metal rack keeps the pork off of
                the pan and allows it to roast more evenly, like it does in commercial ovens described above. Place the
                pork on the rack, leaving as much space as possible between pieces. Pour 1 ½ cups water into the pan
                below the rack. This prevents any drippings from burning or smoking.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">6</span>Transfer the pork to your preheated oven. Roast for 25 minutes,
                keeping the oven setting at 475 F for
                the first 10 minutes of roasting, and then reduce your oven temperature to 375 F (190 C).
                After 25 minutes, flip the pork. If the bottom of the pan is dry, add another cup of water. Turn the pan
                180 degrees to ensure even roasting. Roast another 15 minutes. Throughout the roasting time, check your
                char siu often (every 10 minutes) and reduce the oven temperature if it looks like it is burning!
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">7</span>Meanwhile, combine the reserved marinade with the maltose or
                honey (maltose is very viscous––you can
                heat it up in the microwave to make it easier to work with) and 1 tablespoon hot water. This will be the
                sauce you’ll use for basting the pork.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">8</span> 40 minutes of total roasting time, baste the pork, flip it, and
                baste the other side as well.
                Roast for a final 10 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">9</span>By now, the pork has cooked for 50 minutes total. It should be
                cooked through and caramelized on top.
                If it’s not caramelized to your liking, you can turn the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the
                outside and add some color/flavor. Be sure not to walk away during this process, since the sweet char
                siu BBQ sauce can burn if left unattended. You can also use a meat thermometer to check if the internal
                temperature of the pork has reached 160 degrees F. (Update: USDA recommends that pork should be cooked
                to 145 degrees F with a 3 minute resting time)
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">10</span>Remove from the oven and baste with the last bit of reserved
                BBQ sauce. Let the meat rest for 10
                minutes before slicing, and enjoy!
