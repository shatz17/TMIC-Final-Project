            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <b>For the chile rellenos
            </b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">1</span> Roast the peppers: Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and
            place poblano peppers on top. Set your oven rack directly underneath the broiler and turn the broiler on.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">2</span> Broil poblanos for 5 minutes, or until the skin is blackened and
            blistered. Carefully flip them over and broil for another 5 minutes, or until the skin is blackened and
            blistered.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">3</span> Remove them from the oven and loosely cover the baking sheet with
            aluminum foil or plastic wrap to keep in some of the heat and help them steam. Let them sit for 5 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">4</span> Peel the peppers: Peel and rub off as much of the loose skin on the
            peppers as possible. It doesn't have to be perfect, just as much as you can.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">5</span> Cut a small slit down the middle of the peppers with a knife. (If
            you don't want the peppers too spicy, you can remove some of the seeds. I like to leave them in as poblanos
            aren't typically super spicy to me, but that's personal preference.)
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">6</span> Stuff the peppers: Carefully stuff the peppers with the cheese.
            Some
            of the peppers will be extra fragile because of the roasting process and may tear – that's okay. Just do the
            best you can.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">7</span> Gently close the opening of the peppers and secure it shut with 1-3
            toothpicks. Use as many as you need to ensure that the cheese won't ooze out during the frying process. Set
            aside.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">8</span> Prepare for frying: Heat the oil frying oil in a large saucepan or
            deep skillet over medium-high heat. Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. While oil is
            heating up, prepare the batter.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">9</span> Make the batter: Separate the egg whites from the yolks into two
            separate bowls – the whites into a large mixing bowl and the yolks into a small bowl. Using an electric hand
            mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">10</span> While continuing to beat the egg whites on low, add in the egg
            yolks one at a time until all of them are fully mixed in. The batter should be light, fluffy and smooth.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">11</span> Coat the peppers with batter: Place the flour and salt into a
            separate shallow bowl or plate. Mix together to combine. Gently roll the stuffed peppers in the flour
            mixture, then give them a gentle tap to remove any excess. Then dip them in the egg batter and gently place
            them in the hot frying oil.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">12</span> Fry the chile rellenos: Fry the peppers for 3-5 minutes per side,
            until the batter is golden brown and crispy. Try not to overcrowd the peppers in the pan – I usually fry 2
            at a time depending on the pan I'm using.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">13</span> Transfer the peppers to the lined baking sheet to drain off any
            excess oil.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="ingredient-number">14</span> Serve: Immediately serve chile rellenos on a plate with some
            salsa,
            freshly chopped cilantro and some cotija cheese. (Don't forget to remove the toothpicks when you first cut
            into the peppers! You can try to remove them before serving onto plates, but I find it easier to remove them
            when you first cut into them.)
