            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="ingredient-number">1.</span>In a large cold skillet, arrange bacon in a single layer (don't
                let it overlap too much). Increase heat medium and cook, flipping the pieces often to promote even
                browning, until they reach your desired doneness (8 to 15 minutes).
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">2.</span>Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels. Wipe out the
                skillet and return to medium heat. Spread butter on each cut side of the buns and toast until golden
                brown, 2 to 3 minutes, working in batches if necessary.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">3.</span>Increase heat to medium-high. Form beef into 4 balls, about 4
                ounces each. Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">4.</span>Place burger balls onto the hot griddle or skillet several
                inches apart (working in batches if needed). Using a grill press or spatula, press patties down, making
                burgers as thin and flat as possible. Cook for 2 minutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">5.</span>Flip burger patties, scraping from the pan to keep the layer
                that has formed on the patty. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and
                cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="ingredient-number">6.</span> Spread mayonnaise on each half of a toasted bun. Transfer
                patties to the bottom half of
                each bun. Top with 4 pieces of bacon, and your preferred toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and
                pickles. Top with the top half of the bun and serve.
